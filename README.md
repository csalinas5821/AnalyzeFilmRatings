# AnalyzeFilmRatings
Analyze data on film

The idea involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset containing information about movies, ratings, and users.

Steps for this:
1. Dataset: 
    - use a dataset which contains data on movies, ratings, and users. 

2. Objectives:
    - Data cleaning:
        * handle missing data ( eg., missing ratings, incomplete movie info)
        * standardize formats ( eg., date formats, string formatting)
        * remove duplicates if any

    - Data Analysis:
        * Find the most popular movies based on average ratings.
        * Identify trends in ratings over time (eg., do older movies have better ratings?)
        * Analyze the distribution of ratings (eg., how often do people give 5 star ratings?)
        * Identify which genres tend to receive higher ratings.

3. Tools:
    - Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
    - Matplotlib/seaborn for basic visualizations
    - Numpy for numerical operations

4. Additional Ideas:
    - Include a recommendation system.
